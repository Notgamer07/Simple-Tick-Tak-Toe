# Simple-Tick-Tak-Toe

This is just a simple/basic Tick Tack Toe game using Tkinter in python>

I made this because I was bored while attending a Hackathron wanted to challenge to make a simple TickTakToe game as soon as possible.
I setup an alaram for 4hrs but unexpectedly i created this in 1hr 36mins only.

Quite proud of myself, i am. hehehe
